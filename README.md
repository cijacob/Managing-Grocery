# Managing-Grocery

## Goal
The goal is to provide a simple but complete app for managing groceries of a company. Basically, a list that everyone in
the company can contribute to or check. People using the app should be able to:

 - Add new items to the shopping list
 - Mark an item as bought and introduce how much did it cost
 - Browse through the shopping list
 - Browse through the list of completed items


## Expectations
- This app should be less than 3 days of work (about 24h), and should be delivered in up to one week.
- The app has good UX (very important)
- Release
  - Public Github repo
    - If you prefer a private one, invite us (`StanBoyet`, `larsbs`) on it beforehand
- Code
  - Structure
    - The project has basic features but must be ready to have more, quickly
    - Think about how to abstract the common aspects (API calls, logs, error handling, etc.)
  - Documentation
    - We believe in a minimalistic documentation, as code should be self explanatory. If you feel you need to explain certain aspects though, don't hesitate.
    - Must have: How to run the project.
    - Especially interesting:
      - Where do you think we could put more effort
      - Which parts are you especially proud about
- Tools
  - Whatever you need
  - For the language ideally you'll use JavaScript using any framework of your preference.
    (if you go with React, don't use `create-react-app`)
    Use what you're the most efficient with. You'll have plenty of occasion to experiment with other technologies here ;)
- Bonus
	- Creating an authentication system where only certain users can have access to a particular shopping list, and are able to modify it.
  - Hosted project
    - Heroku or else, if you need a paid tier, ask us to create one for you and to invite you in.
    - Much easier for us to use a hosted version than a local one
  - The app displays some kind of statistics
  - Nicely designed app (You're not a designer, but are expected to make basic decisions on that field while developing)

If you have any questions regarding the project (design, engineering decisions, etc.) let us know!
