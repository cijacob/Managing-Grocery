# Managing-Grocery

## Goal
The goal is to provide a simple but complete app for managing groceries of a company. Basically, a list that everyone in
the company can contribute to or check. People using the app should be able to:

 - Add new items to the shopping list
 - Mark an item as bought and introduce how much did it cost
 - Browse through the shopping list
 - Browse through the list of completed items


## Expectations
- This app should be less than 3 days of work (about 24h), and should be delivered in up to one week.
- The app has good UX (very important)
